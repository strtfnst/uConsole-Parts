# uConsole printed Parts

Parts are in Beta status. 
After delivery of my uConsole and HG board i will make more adjustments to the files. But delivery will take some time. So i try to make the parts as good as possible. delivery date? -> soon/TBA 

## Remix of uConsole parts:
- front cover with some optical changes
- back cover with cutout for official Raspberry passive cooler (currently test printing and waiting for result)
- a new version of a stand. Since the original one would not work with back cover 

## Hackergadgets RTL-SDR board cover
A cover to hide and secure the Hackergadgets board
- 2 versions of cover. One with cutout for SD Card access. And one completly covering the top. 
- Power button stl is provided in 2 clearance version. Standard file is with 0,15mm. Optional is with 0,25. Print the one that fits best.
